# gh-pages release

This folder is a minimal, ready-to-upload package for GitHub Pages containing the static HTML/CSS/JS site.

How to use

- Unzip `gh-pages-release.zip` (or upload the folder contents) into the repository root (or set the Pages source to `gh-pages-release` branch/folder).
- The site entry is `index.html` (links to `Admin_side/Homepage.html` and `Client_side/Homepage.html`).
- If you prefer one of the inner homepages to be the root, rename that file to `index.html` (for example, `Client_side/Homepage.html` → `index.html`).

Notes

- This package includes only `Admin_side/` and `Client_side/` folders and a small `index.html` — unnecessary files and corrupted intermediary files were excluded.
- If you need me to rename pages to `index.html` or normalize filenames (remove spaces), tell me and I will update the release.
